	<h1>Malphas's mansion of random curiosities</h1>

	<p>
		Greetings traveler! Welcome to Malphas's place! As can be seen, this place is rather empty at the moment...in fact so empty I don't think you could even hear the wind mournfully whistling through...because there isn't enough material even for the wind to pass through. Fear not traveller, there is room enough for you in this distant lodging, and soon enough there shall be more to see and hear. For now, rest! And if you wish explore the barebones material that has been laid out for you at present...
