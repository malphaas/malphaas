	<h1>A strange sci-fi dream</h1>

		Dream started with myself among a group in a museum/art gallery of sorts. Apparently it is somewhat in the "far future" and the people consist of a mix of various stages of human-android combinations and some robots made from ground up using non-biologic material (ie just normal robots) kept as servants and slaves. I do not know what I myself was. Exhibitions are full sensory shows combining music, lights, feel, etc. There was one exhibition that particularly struck out to me. It was a large room with purple/red lights moving about and some alien looking plastic-metal stripes extruding out the floor with lots of alienish "pores" on them. When you placed your feet and walked on them, they emitted a low drone that only you could hear along with a staticy-windy feel in your soles. Moving on we seemed to have reached a part of the gallery that showed works demonstrating how the future could be: the sci-fi of that era. It was either a wall full of portals to some place which contained the actual art or a simulation right in the room. It was a large hall like room with gray colored sloping walls and scaled down architecture representing how a future city might be. The sky was gray and cloudy. Everything seemed to be washed in white light. At this point I began noticing some of my group mates. They were the usual mix of various kinds of human-androids of course, but among them two stuck out. One was of course a normal robot of the sort mentioned above, who belonged to us. The other was what seemed a human-android of rather advanced form. An insectoid looking female with dark blue colored "skin" and jet black eyes. She seemed to have vanished somewhere while we were walking about in this exhibition. We then reached the edge of this room and what really was a portal. It was "closed" and we could not travel to the other side but we could see what was going on there, and apparently so could the beings on the other side. I was wondering about the significance of all this when suddenly one of the beings on the other side stopped and started talking or rather lecturing to us, I was a bit taken aback to note she looked not much unlike the female android in our group I just spoke of. The general gist of the lecture was that we are yet inferior beings and won't be allowed into the other side unless we develop and grow suitably. There were also some subtle hints placed as to what might happen to our world if at any point these beings felt we failed and could never grow to be good enough for them, hints which I at that moment couldn't actually catch. Our robot however turned out be quite astute. He asked something to the tune of "And what would happen if we failed?". She (the "superior being") answered telling us that the I-IV-V Organization (I had been looking up guitar chords and theory irl) would handle the scenario appropriately and we would, become "food" for them. It was apparently a way more complex concept but that was a simple enough approximation that we could have understood. The I-IV-V Organization in my dream was a group of experts and elites who constantly monitored things like the world economy, diseases, etc in short keeping tabs on the basic pulse of human (or whatever we were) life on the planet. And among its responsibilities included...taking appropriate steps if things go too awry. Stated more simply, they had a kill switch for all life on the planet if they ever felt that was the saner option (such as say opposed to dying off to an incurable virulent disease slowly and painfully). The female on the other side had now gone quiet, having finished her lecture, and then walked away to wherever. It was at this moment that I noticed the similar female in our group return. She seemed really alarmed and depressed and brought me to a somewhat private place to communicate what she had seen. Apparently, she for some reason had been allowed a short visit to the other side. She communicated what she had seen there to me hurriedly, I could also see some visions and memories of her in my mind as she continued talking. These beings on the other side were, most of the time, connected to a medical system consisting of a complex almost fungal web of tubes that connect to various veins and vitals of them. This setup also seems to often turn them slowly insane and in many cases slowly take away what she described as their "soul". She seemed to imply she felt something fundamentally gone awry in this future/distant civilization and perhaps it might be our responsibility to course-correct. There were other things she had said but this is more or less what I remember on waking up, which I did shortly after.
