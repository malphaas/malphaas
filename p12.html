	<h1>Counting set bits in integers upto a number</h1>

	<p>
		If we write down the column of binary representations from 0 to 2<sup>N</sup>-1 we see a pattern emerge:
	</p>

<pre>
000
001
010
011
100
101
110
111
</pre>
	<p>
		Let us assume we are speaking of the kth least significant bit position (k=0 for lsb, k=1 for 2's position, k=2 for
		4's position, and so on). We observe the digits form alternative blocks of size 2**k that flip between 0 and 1.
		For example the first 4 bits in the 3rd bit (k=2) are 0, then next 4 bits are 1 if we read from top to bottom. 
	</p>

	<p>
		Let our goal be to find the number of one bits in the binary representations within all integers in [0,n) = [0,n-1].
		Let us consider the kth bit position. So the block size is m. In order to find the index of the block our number
		belongs to, we compute s=floor(n/2**k), and the index of the number within the block is t=n%(2**k).
		The number of 1-blocks upto and before the current block is s/2 since every alternate block is all 1s.
		So the number of bits gathered till now is (s/2)*2**k. Next we have to compute the remaining set bits inside the last
		block. The index of our number is t, which means we have a total of (t+1) numbers under consideration
		that fall inside the last block.
		However it depends on index of block, even indices are all zero, odd indices are all one. So we add 
		(s%2)*(t+1), the modulus condition takes care of block parity.
	</p>

	<p>
		Summing up, and traversing the powers from LSB to MSB:
	</p>

<pre>
int f(int n) {
	int p=1,c=0,m;

	while(p<=n) {
		m=n/p;
		c+=(m/2)*p + (m%2)*(n%p+1);
		p*=2;
	}

	return c;
}
</pre>

<p>
	This is obviously of O(log n) time complexity.
