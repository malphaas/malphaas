	<h1>Another strange dream</h1>

	<p>
		This one was, you shall be relieved to know, much shorter than my previous dream. This time dream logic finds me in the pristine woodlands of Norway. What is more is that I am witnessing a kind of party or
		picnic in a large grassy clearing. The weather is cold, almost or a bit colder than freezing point. Suddenly who comes to disrupt the party but Abbath, fully dressed up and painted of course. And weilding a
		scythe. With which he attacks the party goers. So of course they scurry and run away from the place quickly. Music starts playing and it suddenly dawns on me that I am actually witnessing a new Abbath video.
		Except this time he is playing country/rockabilly of some kind instead of the usual black metal. There is another man in the video too, and they are seen collecting a huge pile of firewood in the middle of
		the clearing, it was in a solid square of approximately 15x15 metres, and taller than human height. They set it alight while the music continues playing in the background, then they are seen wawrming 
		themselves near the pile, snow melting away from its heat. Some other activities are also going on at the behest of the other guy. One moment particularly stood out: a mistake by the operator of a large
		backhoe due to which a good amount of earth falls on his face. The dream ends with the music video still going on.
