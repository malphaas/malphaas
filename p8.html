	<h1>A simple dragon curve sequence program</h1>

	<p>
		The dragon curve is the curve you get when you repeatedly fold a strip of paper on itself always along the same direction with respect to the closed edge, then expand it so that all the folds are
		right angles. If we denote a right turn by 1 and a left turn by 0 the first few iterations of the sequence would be as follows (the sequence starts at one fold ie two edges):
	</p>

	<pre>
		1
		1<b>1</b>0
		110<b>1</b>100
		1101100<b>1</b>1100100
		110110011100100<b>1</b>110110001100100
	</pre>

	<p>
		...and so on. It can be seen that each iteration is simply the complemented mirror image of the previous iteration appended to itself with a 1 in between. Let our current index be i and let us assume
		it is not one of the nodal points with '1' value described. The situation is like this:
	</p>

	<p>
		(0,1,2,...,2<sup>k</sup>-2)(2<sup>k</sup>-1)(2<sup>k</sup>,...,i,...,2<sup>k+1</sup>-2)
	</p>

	<p>
		The position of i in the second mirror image half is (i-2<sup>k</sup>), thus its reflection in the first half would be at (2<sup>k</sup>-2) - (i-2<sup>k</sup>) = 2*(2<sup>k</sup>-1)-i where 2<sup>k-1</sup> is 
		of course the index of the nodal point. In the code below the running nodal index is denoted by the variable tk and n is the number of bits to generate.
	</p>
	
	<pre>
&#35;include&nbsp;&lt;stdio.h&gt;

int&nbsp;main()&nbsp;{
	int&nbsp;i,tk=0,n=400&#59;
	int&nbsp;d[1000]&#59;
	d[0]=1&#59;

	printf("%d",d[0])&#59;
	for(i=1&#59;i&lt;n&#59;i++)&nbsp;{
		if(i==tk*2+1)&nbsp;{&nbsp;tk=i&#59;&nbsp;d[i]=1&#59;&nbsp;}
		else&nbsp;d[i]=&#33;d[2*tk-i]&#59;
		printf("%d",d[i])&#59;
	}

	printf("\n")&#59;
	return&nbsp;0&#59;
}
